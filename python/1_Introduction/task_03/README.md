# Arithmetic Operators

**Task**

The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, **$a$** and **$b$**. Add code to print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

**Example**

$a = 3$

$b = 5$

Print the following:
```shell
8
-2
15
```

**Input Format**

The first line contains the first integer, **$a$**.

The second line contains the second integer, **$b$**.

**Constraints**

$1 \leq a \leq 10^10$

$1 \leq b \leq 10^10$

**Output Format**

Print the three lines as explained above.

**Sample Input 0**
```shell
3
2
```

**Sample Output 0**
```shell
5
1
6
```

**Explanation 0**

$3 + 2 \Rightarrow 5$

$3 -2 \Rightarrow 1$

$3 * 2 \Rightarrow 6$
